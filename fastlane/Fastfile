# Fastlane Configuration Template
#
# This is a template file for fastlane automation.
# You need to implement your own fastlane configuration based on your requirements.
#
# Common lanes you might want to implement:
# - build: Build the app
# - test: Run tests  
# - archive: Create archive for distribution
# - upload_dsym: Upload debug symbols
# - deploy: Deploy to App Store or TestFlight
#
# For detailed documentation, visit:

    # 1. Code signing with match
    # 2. Building archive with gym
    # 3. Uploading to TestFlight with pilot
    # 4. Uploading debug symbols

# Example environment variables you might want to use:
# ENV["SCHEME"] - Xcode scheme to build
# ENV["CONFIGURATION"] - Build configuration (Debug/Release)
# ENV["APP_IDENTIFIER"] - App bundle identifier
# ENV["TEAM_ID"] - Apple Developer Team ID
# ENV["APPLE_USERNAME"] - Apple Developer account username
# ENV["MATCH_GIT_URL"] - Git repository for certificates (if using match)
# ENV["CRASHLYTICS_API_TOKEN"] - For uploading dSYMs to Crashlytics
